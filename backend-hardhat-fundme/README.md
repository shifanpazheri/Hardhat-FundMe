# hardhat-fund-me-fcc
FundMe is a sample funding contract written in Solidity. This contract provides a basic structure for creating a funding mechanism using price feeds as a library. It can be used as a starting point for building your own crowdfunding or fundraising contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
# Features
* Allows users to contribute funds to a project
* Maintains a list of contributors and their respective contributions
* Implements a price feed library for fetching current prices
* Provides a mechanism for the project owner to withdraw funds
# Prerequisites
To run or interact with the FundMe contract, you will need the following:
* A development environment with Solidity compiler support (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
* An Ethereum network or a local blockchain for deployment and testing
* An Ethereum wallet or browser extension (e.g., MetaMask) for interacting with the contract
# Getting Started
1. Clone the FundMe repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/FundMe.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd FundMe
3. Install the required dependencies: yarn
4. Compile the Solidity contract using your preferred development environment or compiler.
5. Deploy the contract to your chosen Ethereum network or local blockchain. Make sure you have the necessary credentials and network configuration set up.
6. Interact with the deployed contract using a wallet or browser extension, such as MetaMask. You can contribute funds, retrieve contributions, or withdraw funds as the project owner.
